/**
 * Represents a restroom's accessibility details.
 *
 * - `doorWidth` - Is door wide enough for accessibility. The width should be at least 75 cm when fully open.
 * - `roomSpaciousness` - Represents whether the room is spacious enough for a wheelchair. The
 *                        restroom should allow a wheelchair turning radius of at least 150 cm to be fully accessible.
 * - `grabRails` - Rails that are present near the toilet. Rails should be on both sides and steady
 *                 enough to support the user's weight.
 * - `toiletSeat` - The seat height of the toilet. The seat height should be between 45â€“50 cm
 *                  from the ground to allow for easy transfers.
 * - `sink` - Accessibility of the sink. The sink should be reachable from a seated position (about 80 cm).
 * - `hasEmergencyAlarm` - Emergency alarm system for calling help in emergencies (usually a pull cord
 *                         or string placed near the toilet and close to the floor so users can easily
 *                         reach it even if they have fallen).
 * - `euroKey` - Specifies if the restroom requires a EuroKey for access. This is additional
 *               information and does not directly affect accessibility.
 * - `additionalInfo` - A field for extra notes or specific details about the restroom's
 *                      accessibility features. Does not affect accessibility.
 *
 * Combined, these factors determine whether the restroom is fully or partially accessible,
 * inaccessible, or unknown due to missing information (we should prefer labelling as `UNKNOWN`
 * rather than risk mislabeling the whole restroom as `FULLY_ACCESSIBLE` or `NOT_ACCESSIBLE`).
 *
 * **NOTE:** These values are based on the UN design manuals. See
 *           [here](https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/designm/AD2-10.htm).
