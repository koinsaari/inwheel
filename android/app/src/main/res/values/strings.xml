    <string name="about">About</string>
    <string name="about_title">ℹ️ About This App</string>
    <string name="about_body">
        Hi, I\'m Aaro — the developer of this app.\n\nI created this to make accessibility information for public places in Switzerland 🇨🇭 easier to find and understand.\n\nMost map services either ignore accessibility or simplify it to vague labels like "wheelchair accessible," which often isn\'t enough. For anyone with mobility challenges, details matter — steps, ramps, door widths, restrooms. This app is built to show those details clearly.
    </string>
    <string name="the_goal_title">🎯 The Goal</string>
    <string name="the_goal_body">
        My goal is to offer highly detailed, accurate accessibility data for public places — starting in Switzerland.\n\nPlace data comes from OpenStreetMap (OSM), an open mapping platform. Since OSM data is often incomplete, I built and maintain an open-source database alongside it to capture more detailed accessibility information.\n\nThe idea is to go beyond yes-or-no labels, and show how accessible each place actually is.

        This app is still early in development and lacks many features. There may be bugs, missing data, and things that need improving — and I\'m working on it whenever I have the time.\n\nUpdates will come over time, especially based on feedback. The goal is to keep it free, open, and useful.

        This app uses Google Maps because of its stability and advanced features, which makes handling thousands of places in the map much more user friendly.

As long as there\'s no external funding, features and growth will be balanced with what\'s realistically sustainable.\n

    <!-- Info Dialogs -->
    <string name="info_general_accessibility">
        A fully accessible place should have step-free access, wide doors, and enough space to move around independently. The entrance, indoor areas, and restroom all play a role in how usable a place is. Even if one of these works well, missing accessibility elsewhere can still make a visit difficult.
    </string>

    <string name="info_indoor_accessibility">
        Indoor areas should be step-free and wide enough for a wheelchair to move and turn. Hallways should allow easy passage, and any changes in level should be covered with ramps or lifts. Narrow passages, internal stairs, or tight spaces can limit access even when the entrance is accessible.
    </string>

    <string name="info_entrance_accessibility">
        The entrance should be level or have a ramp, with a door wide enough for wheelchair access. A minimum width of 90 cm is recommended. Small thresholds under 3 cm are generally fine, but anything higher may require a ramp. Automatic or easy-to-open doors improve access significantly.
    </string>

    <string name="info_additional_info">
        In this field, you can add any extra details here that don\'t fit the standard categories.\n\nNote things like temporary obstacles, staff assistance, nearby parking, surface quality, or anything else that might help others understand the accessibility better.
    </string>

    <string name="info_restroom_accessibility">
        An accessible restroom should have enough space to enter and move with a wheelchair, secure grab rails for support, and a toilet and sink that are easy to reach. The door should be wide enough, and features like an emergency alarm or Euro key access can also make a big difference. Even if a place is accessible overall, the lack of a usable restroom can still be a major barrier.
    </string>

    <string name="info_step_count">
        Step count refers to the number of steps at the entrance.\n\nZero steps usually means the entrance is fully accessible. A very small step under 3 cm is often still manageable with a wheelchair or walker.\n\nOne or two steps may be partially accessible, depending on height and context. Three or more steps typically make the entrance not accessible unless there is a ramp or lift.
    </string>

    <string name="info_step_height">
        Step height indicates how tall the highest step is at the entrance.\n\nA threshold or step under 3 cm is generally still considered accessible. Steps between 3–10 cm may be manageable with help or a small ramp.\n\nAnything above 10 cm is usually a barrier without a proper ramp or lift.
    </string>

    <string name="info_ramp">
        This indicates whether a ramp is available to bypass any steps.\n\nTo be accessible, a ramp should have a gentle slope (ideally 1:12), be wide enough for a wheelchair, have handrails, and a non-slip surface.\n\nEven if a ramp exists, it may still be hard to use if it\'s too steep or narrow.
    </string>

    <string name="info_lift">
        This tells whether a lift or platform lift is available to overcome vertical barriers like stairs.\n\nLifts are essential for accessibility in multi-level buildings.\n\nIt\'s helpful to know if the lift can be used independently or if it requires assistance or a key.
    </string>

    <string name="info_entrance_width">
        Entrance width refers to the width of the main access point or door into the building.\n\nAn accessible entrance typically has a clear width of at least 90 cm. Anything below 75 cm is usually too narrow for wheelchairs.\n\nThis helps determine if someone using mobility aids can get through the entrance comfortably.
    </string>

    <string name="info_door_type">
        Door type refers to how the door opens and how suitable it is for people with limited mobility.\n\nAutomatic sliding and automatic swinging doors are generally the most accessible, as they open without physical effort.\n\nManual swinging and manual sliding doors can be accessible if they are lightweight, easy to open, and have user-friendly handles.\n\nRevolving doors, which rotate around a central axis, may require timing and coordination. Double doors, with two panels that open in the middle, can vary in accessibility depending on space and ease of use.
    </string>

    <string name="info_door_width">
        Door width determines whether a person using a wheelchair or walker can pass through comfortably.\n\nA width of at least 90 cm is considered fully accessible. Widths between 75–89 cm may be manageable with smaller wheelchairs or with difficulty.\n\nAnything below 75 cm is typically too narrow for safe access with mobility aids.
    </string>

    <string name="info_room_maneuver">
        Room maneuver refers to the space inside a restroom or other accessible area to move and turn a wheelchair.\n\nTo be fully accessible, there should be enough space for a full 360-degree turn — usually a diameter of at least 150 cm.\n\nLimited space can make it very difficult to use the room independently.
    </string>

    <string name="info_grab_rails">
        Grab rails provide support for transferring to and from the toilet or for general stability.\n\nAccessible restrooms should have secure, horizontal and/or vertical rails placed next to the toilet and sometimes near the sink or door.\n\nMissing or improperly placed rails can make the restroom difficult or dangerous to use.
    </string>

    <string name="info_sink">
        The sink should be accessible from a seated position.\n\nThere should be clear space underneath for a wheelchair, and the faucet should be reachable and usable with limited hand strength.\n\nVery high, deep, or obstructed sinks may not be accessible even if the rest of the restroom is.
    </string>

    <string name="info_toilet_seat">
        The toilet seat height should be comfortable and safe for people transferring from a wheelchair.\n\nTypically, a seat height of 45–50 cm is considered accessible. Seats that are too low or too high can make transfers difficult or risky.\n\nSome accessible toilets may also include support backrests or additional features.
    </string>

    <string name="info_emergency_alarm">
        Emergency alarms allow users to call for help in case of an incident inside the restroom.\n\nAccessible restrooms should have clearly marked alarm cords or buttons that are reachable from the toilet or floor level.\n\nIf no alarm is present or it\'s out of reach, it may not be safe for independent use.
    </string>

    <string name="info_euro_key">
        A Euro key system is used across many European countries to allow access to locked accessible toilets.\n\nIf a place uses the Euro key system, users with a registered key can unlock and use the facility independently.\n\nThis can help ensure accessibility while keeping the facilities secure and clean.
