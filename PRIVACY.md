# Privacy Policy

**Last Modified: 9 May 2025**

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how InWheel handles information when you use the app. For other legal terms and disclaimers, please refer to our Terms of Service.

## What Data We Collect

InWheel does not collect or store any personal data directly. The app may temporarily access your device's location to determine nearby accessibility information, but this data is not stored or sent to our servers.

Our backend provider (Supabase) may automatically log technical data such as IP addresses and request metadata, solely for security and operational diagnostics. This data is not linked to your identity.

## How We Use Data

Your device's location is used only to determine which places to display on the map. Logged technical data is used to maintain app performance and troubleshoot errors. No personal profiles or behavioral tracking is conducted.

## Third-Party Services

We use third-party services that may process limited data under their own privacy policies:

- **Google Maps** for location services and map rendering. [View Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- **Firebase** for analytics and core functionality. [View Firebase's Privacy Policy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy)
- **Supabase** for backend storage and data access. [View Supabase's Privacy Policy](https://supabase.com/privacy)

## Your Rights

While we do not store personal data, you may disable location access via your device settings at any time. If you believe we have inadvertently received personal data, please contact us to request deletion.

**Contact:** [info@inwheel.ch](mailto:info@inwheel.ch)

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy periodically. Changes will be posted within the app or on our website. Continued use after updates implies acceptance.
