# The project

This is a multi-platform application project that focuses on providing detailed accessibility information for different places (restaurants, etc.) in Switzerland. The project is still in its early stages, and currently, only the Android version is under development.

The goal of this project is to provide detailed and reliable accessibility information for places across Switzerland, specifically tailored for individuals with disabilities. We use a custom database built on top of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to provide this. The problem is that OSM data does not provide comprehensive or consistent accessibility information, and obtaining such data from other platforms like Google Maps is often costly and restrictive. This project aims to address these issues by building a platform where users can easily contribute and update accessibility details themselves.
